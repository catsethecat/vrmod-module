Right click Garry's Mod in your Steam library and press "Properties".
In the Properties window, open the "Local files" tab and press "Browse local files".
This should open your GarrysMod folder which is located in .../common/GarrysMod.
Go back one folder into that "common" folder.

Drag the GarrysMod folder that is next to this INSTALLATION.txt into that "common" folder.
(Not onto the GarrysMod folder in common)
